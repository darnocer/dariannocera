Many people search so hard for meaning in life; to find their purpose. This question once plagued me to no end. It was only once I let go of the need to find an answer to this question that the meaning revealed itself to me. 

I believe we all have purpose, maybe multiple purposes. And those purposes may change over time. 

There is one thing for sure that will not steer you wrong on your quest: your internal compass. To focus on what lights you up— what brings you joy— can never possibly be a waste of time.

Otherwise, life truly would be meaningless.

But to pursue a meaningful life of passionate purpose requires authenticity and vulnerability. And to expose your true self is really scary. It opens the essence of who you are up to criticism from people that do not understand you. 

When I follow my intuition, it leads me to believe that simply being myself is part of my purpose on this Earth; to inspire others to live a more authentic life— to inspire others to inspire others— through sharing my perspective and experiences.

Writing is only one medium to realize this purpose. And to be honest, it would be much more comfortable, much less anxiety-inducing, for my introverted self to keep my thoughts and feelings out of the digital realm.

For a long time, writing was always extremely personal to me. I have literally thought before that I would rather die than for someone to read my journal (dramatic, I know). 

But at this point in my life, keeping my truths locked away in my private notebooks doesn't do anyone any good. The internet opens the possibility that my ideas may reach and resonate with people I would have never otherwise connected with, which is actually quite exciting.

And so, you are witnessing here my very first exercise in vulnerability. Publishing this post.

I hope with time and practice, I can continue to cultivate the courage required to share more of myself and say the things about the world I'm afraid to say, in hopes it might resonate with people and guide them toward their most authentic life. 

It would be egotistical to say I am doing this only to help others— this is also a personal challenge to expand my comfort zone.

And maybe there is healing to be accomplished here, too.
