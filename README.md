## 👋🏼 About

I maintain a portfolio at [darian.digital](https://darian.digital) to showcase my professional value that evolves with the type of work I'm doing at the time.

I've struggled for a bit with the idea that the whole point of a professional portfolio is to get a job, but I also wanted to create a personal website where I could share writing unrelated to my profession (and maybe even writing that will do the opposite of get me a job).

It occurred to me there's nothing wrong with having two websites if they serve different purposes. Thus, the creatively named [dariannocera.com](dariannocera.com) was born.
