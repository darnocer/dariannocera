Some people search so hard for meaning in life; to find their purpose. I once was a lost soul, but at this point in my life I am grateful to be quite content with the meaning of life and my purpose in it as I understand it.

I believe we all have purpose. We may all have multiple purposes. And I believe those purposes can change over time. But there is one thing for sure: your internal compass will never steer you wrong. To focus on what lights you up, what brings you joy, can never possibly be a waste of time.

Otherwise, life truly would be meaningless.

But to pursue a meaningful life of passion requires authenticity and vulnerability. And to expose your true self is really scary. Like, terrifying.

I believe part of why I am on this Earth is simply to allow my authentic self to shine through; to inspire others to live their best, most authentic life through sharing my experiences. It isn't always pretty, but when I can play a part in helping someone realize their potential in this life, it absolutely overflows my cup.

Writing is only one medium to realize this purpose. And to be honest, it would be much more comfortable, much less anxiety-inducing, for my introverted self to keep my thoughts and feelings out of the digital realm.

For a long time, writing was always extremely personal to me. I have literally thought before that I would rather die than for someone to read my journal (dramatic, I know). But the longer I keep these truths locked away in my private notebooks, the deeper the yearning to express and share them more widely with others becomes. The possibility my ideas may reach people I would have never otherwise connected with excites me to no end.

And so, you are witnessing here my very first exercise in vulnerability. Publishing this post.

I hope with time and practice, I can cultivate the courage required to share the deeper and darker parts of myself with complete strangers. It would be egotistical to say I am doing this only to help others. This is a personal challenge to expand my comfort zone.

And there is healing to be accomplished here, too.
