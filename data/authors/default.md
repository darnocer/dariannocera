## In a Nutshell

I'm a gal that lives in Colorado. I like to code and write things. I wear a lot of hats. Metaphorically and literally. I try to pry myself away from my projects at least once a day and spend time outside. It's pretty nice out there. Anywho, thanks for visiting. I don't have anything to sell you.

## About This Site

This is my personal digital playground to practice writing and ultimately do whatever the heck I want. I think hard about a lot of stuff and sometimes it makes my brain really hot so I thought maybe sharing my thoughts could cool it down. I'm a pretty private person, so this is an experiment in \~\*vulnerability\*\~ ðŸ§ª. I hope you find something of value.
