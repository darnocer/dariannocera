I have cardboard boxes and storage bins filled with all of my full journals since high school. In recent years, I now digitally take notes and journal more than ever. I document my thoughts, feelings, ideas, interests, and reflections every day. I take notes from books and podcasts, and things I want to remember. I "write" every day. I have _thousands_ of notes and documents.

But I don't consider myself a writer.

Perhaps an obvious reason is because I have not yet publicized any of this "writing". But most of my notes are digital chicken scratch— Incoherent, run-on sentences; haphazard, disorganized word vomit; incomplete ideas and unfinished lists— So simply publicizing my "writing" in such a crude form certainly would _not_ make me feel like a "writer".

So what even IS writing, then?

It's increasingly obvious putting words onto paper is not equivalent to writing. As I've pondered this question in the last few days desperate to publish something, ANYTHING, it occurred to me that outside of school assignments, as much as I thought I loved writing, I honestly may have never actually "written" anything in my life.

I've been wanting to publish a personal blog for a looong time. I love thinking deeply about things. My mind feels like an endless faucet of ideas and connections. I have so many thoughts dancing around in my head that I want to explore more deeply and share with the world.

Capturing these ideas in bullet points is the easy part. But attempting to write in a way that is engaging, interesting, and valuable for others; actually finding the language to convey meaning and make the reader feel what you feel; now that is hard. It almost seems as if the meaning of the idea evaporates into nothingness once there is an active attempt to convey it.

Ugh, same, Kurt.

Since I've taken an interest in writing more seriously, I've been inspired by many modern writers (or in most cases, entrepreneurs that also happen to write). The irony is many of them write about writing. And one thing is clear: writing seemingly comes easily to no one.

Well, shit. There you have it.

I wouldn't have a serious think on the couch in front of the TV, while co-working with a friend, while in a noisy cafe, so why do I think I can seriously write in those environments? Quality writing output most definitely requires a state of flow.

I'll go even one step further and call writing "learning", too. A wild phenomena occurs in the act of writing about an idea you thought you understood well. You know what you want to say, you just need to say it. But the mere process of formulating words to convey the idea, you actually end up learning more about the topic than you understood to begin with.

(In fact, this post is literally not at all what I thought it was going to be when I started writing it.)

Perhaps I am jaded from the world of digital marketing, but it unfortunately feels "blog" has been completely bastardized into SEO tactics, affiliate links, and AI-generated content. You won't find that here, though. You'll only find raw discipline and perseverance to push past the blocks and an ongoing struggle with confidence to hit publish.

If you've considered, like me, exploring writing and sharing, I can validate that this is indeed supposed to be hard.

But I think if you have something worth saying, you'll find a way to say it.
