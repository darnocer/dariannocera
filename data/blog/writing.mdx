I have cardboard boxes and storage bins filled with all of my full journals since high school. In recent years, I now digitally take notes and journal more than ever. I document my thoughts, feelings, ideas, interests, and reflections every day. I take notes from books and podcasts, and things I want to remember. I "write" every day. I have _thousands_ of notes and documents.

**But I don't consider myself a writer.**

Perhaps an obvious reason is that I have not yet publicized any of this "writing". But most of my notes are digital chicken scratch— Incoherent, run-on sentences; haphazard, disorganized word vomit; incomplete ideas and unfinished lists— So simply publicizing my "writing" in such a crude form certainly would _not_ make me feel like a "writer".

So what even IS writing, then?

It's increasingly obvious putting words onto paper is not equivalent to writing. As I've pondered this question in the last few days desperate to publish something, ANYTHING, it occurred to me that outside of school assignments, I honestly may have never truly "written" anything in my life.

I've been wanting to publish a personal blog for a looong time. I love thinking deeply, solving problems, and formulating theories around complex subjects. My mind feels like an endless faucet of ideas and connections. My motivation is to explore these ideas more deeply and share them with others that are like-minded.

Capturing these ideas as bullet points in my notes is the easy part. But attempting to write in a way that is engaging, interesting, and valuable for others— actually finding the language to convey meaning and make the reader feel what you feel— now that is hard. Sometimes it seems the meaning of the idea evaporates into nothingness once I make an active attempt to convey it.

Since I've taken a more serious interest in writing, I've been inspired by many modern writers (or in many cases, entrepreneurs that also happen to write). The irony is many of them write about writing. And one thing is clear: writing doesn't come easily to anyone.

Well, shit. We've cracked the code.

It makes complete sense why this writing thing is so hard. Thinking is hard. And writing _is_ thinking.

We all have non-stop thoughts all day long (to varying degrees, depending on your practice of mindfulness). Thoughts are outputs of your inputs: a culmination of the media you consume, the people you interact with, and the experiences you've had in your life. In a way, thoughts happen to you— they're passive.

For instance, stop and think about what your next thought is going to be.

. . .

Yep, you can't— you won't know what your next thought is until it happens.

Thinking, on the other hand, is not the same as having thoughts. It's an _active_ process of using logic and reasoning to formulate a judgment or solve a problem. It's is not something you can do surrounded by distractions, whether external or internal. It takes effort and focus.

And if you want quality outputs, **you need to ensure you have quality inputs**.

Writing is piecing together a puzzle that has an infinite number of solutions. For your efforts, learning is an inherent reward to the writing process. In the process of formulating words to convey an idea, it helps you learn and understand more about the topic than you thought you knew to begin with.<Subnote text="In fact, this post is literally not at all what I thought it was going to be when I started writing it." />

"Blogs" have unfortunately been completely bastardized into SEO tactics, affiliate links, and AI-generated content. And even though this blog will die with the rest of the endless sea of bullshit out there, you're looking at raw discipline and perseverance to push past the blocks and an ongoing struggle with the confidence to hit publish (and now I've learned what writing is— neat!).

If you've considered, like me, sharing your ideas through writing, I can validate that this is indeed supposed to be hard.

But I think if you have something worth saying, you'll find a way to say it.
