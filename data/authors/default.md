## In a Nutshell

I'm a gal living in Colorado that's on a mission to live her best life. I quit my job because it sucked and now I do freelance web development and project management. I take on projects that sounds interesting because I like to try new things, learn and grow. Right now, I'm working with Next.js and Webflow.

I like to do a lot of different things with my time in general so I rigorously design my life around stuff I like. I try to be a good person and help people where I can. I think it's cool to be nice and respect others', including their viewpoints, even if they're different from yours.

I think hard about a lot of stuff and sometimes it makes my brain really hot so I thought maybe I could use an outlet. Here it is. Take it or leave it.
