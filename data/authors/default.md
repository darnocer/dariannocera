## In a Nutshell

I'm a hybrid specialist/generalist, focusing on web development. I like to code, design, and write things. I'm interested in the topics of technology, productivity, business, and philosophy.

## My Hobbies

When I'm not on my laptop, I like to play ukulele, ride mountain bikes, camp in the Colorado wilderness, listen to JRE, read self-help books, practice yoga and meditation, tend to my rock and plant collections, make mac n cheese, and think and learn about the Universe.

### About this Site

I'm a pretty private person, so the thought of putting myself out there on the internet is rather anxiety-inducing. I'm trying out an experiment to share my authentic self with the world and see where it goes. This experiment is very much in progress, but I hope you'll find something of value and follow along.
