## 👋🏼 About

I maintain a portfolio at [darian.digital](https://darian.digital) to showcase my professional value that generally evolves with the type of work I'm doing at the time. I wanted a little corner of the internet where I can post thoughts unrelated to my profession. It occurred to methere's nothing wrong with having two websites if they serve different purposes. Thus, [darian.blog](https://darian.blog) was born.
