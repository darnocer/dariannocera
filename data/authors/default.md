## In a Nutshell

I'm a gal that lives in Colorado. I like to code and write things. I'm a developer, but wear a lot of hats. Metaphorically and literally. I do try to pry myself away from my projects and spend time outside. It's pretty nice out there. Anywho, thanks for visiting. I don't have anything to sell you.

## About this Site

This is my personal digital playground to practice writing and ultimately do whatever the heck I want. I think hard about stuff and sometimes it makes my brain really hot so I thought maybe this could cool it down. I'm a pretty private person, so this is an experiment to share part of myself with the world. We'll see how it goes.
