## In a Nutshell

I'm a gal living in Colorado that's on a mission to live her best life. Working 9-5 SUCKED, so now freelance web development, project management, and consulting pays the bills. I have a lot of interests and rigorously design my life around them. I try to be a good person and help people where I can, and I think others should, too.

## About This Blog

I think hard about a lot of stuff and sometimes it makes my brain really hot, so I thought maybe I could use an outlet.. here it is! I do this for myself and hope to add value for others at the same time. I have interests in topics including personal growth, philosophy, the \~Universe\~, mental health, PKM <Subnote text="PKM (Personal Knowledge Management) is the process of collecting, storing, classifying, and retrieving information."/>, psychedelics, spirituality, technology, and history which will be reflected in my posts. If you don't like that stuff, then get outta here for your own sake.
